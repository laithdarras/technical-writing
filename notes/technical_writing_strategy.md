# Technical Writing Strategy & Process

This document dives into the strategy and process behind strong technical writing. From planning to polishing, 
this guide explores how to write clearly, accurately, and efficiently - with the audience in mind.

## Strategic Questions to Ask Before Writing
1. What is your purpose for writing?
2. What do you want your audience to know or do?
3. Who is your audience?
4. What’s important to your reader?
5. What is your professional identity?

Also consider:
- What happened that triggered the need to communicate?
- What is the broader context?

## Structuring Your Writing
- **Use Hierarchical Sections**:
  - Example: 1 -> 1.1 -> 1.1.1 -> 1.1.1.1
  - Or Roman/numeric/alphabetical order: I -> A -> 1 -> a
- **External Balance**: Uniform section numbering
- **Internal Balance**: Even section lengths
- Prioritize **logic and clarity** over strict formatting

---

## Positioning Your Writing
- Know your audience early to avoid rewrites
- Tailor your tone and detail level accordingly
- Choose a writing perspective (1st, 2nd, 3rd person) and be consistent

---

## Word Choice: Concise & Precise
**To be concise:**
- Avoid fluff
- Replace wordy phrases
- Shorten and simplify without losing meaning

**To be precise:**
- Use measurable quantities
- Avoid vague modifiers (e.g., "some," "huge," "countless")
- Use positive declarations (e.g., “exclude” vs. “do not include”)

---

## Common Traps to Avoid
- **Cliches**: Replace figure of speech with technical language
- **Anthropomorphism**: Don’t assign emotion to systems (“the code failed miserably” -> “the code failed”)
- **Malapropisms**: Don’t confuse similar-sounding words ("costumer" != "customer")
- **Erroneous Heterographs**: "coarse" vs. "course" - proofread carefully
- **Jargon**: Define domain-specific terms and acronyms at first use
- **Avoid "very"**: Replace phrases like "very small" -> "tiny"

## Making Your Writing Interesting
Interesting writing improves retention. Light humor may be used in:
- Manuals, reports, blogs, newsletters
But, NOT in:
- Proposals, resumes, safety docs, journal articles
- Use humor responsibly - always remain clear and professional
