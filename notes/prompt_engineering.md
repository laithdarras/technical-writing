# Writing with Generative AI & Prompt Engineering for Engineers

Generative AI (GenAI) is a transformative tool for technical communication, research, and creative problem-solving. Whether you’re drafting reports, 
studying complex systems, or brainstorming project ideas, knowing how to **use GenAI ethically and effectively** will give you a significant professional edge.

## What is Generative AI?
- A class of AI that creates **new content** (text, images, code, music) from existing data
- Trained on massive datasets, it can recognize patterns and simulate human-like responses

**Why it matters to engineers:** It boosts writing, ideation, research, documentation, and learning.

## How GenAI Can Help You as a Student/Engineer
- Summarize technical readings or lecture notes
- Generate study guides or flashcards
- Brainstorm design solutions
- Draft reports, cover letters, resumes, and emails
- Create tables, templates, diagrams (Markdown/LaTeX/HTML)
- Debug code
- Personal tutoring and concept explanation
- Organize project timelines and schedules

> Use these tools responsibly - AI can enhance your learning, not replace it.

## Prompt Engineering 101
Effective prompts = better output. Treat prompting like writing clear instructions to a colleague.

### Prompt Structure: The 5 Ws + 1 H
- **Who**: What role should the AI assume? (e.g., You are a software engineer...)
- **What**: What task should it do? (e.g., Write, analyze, debug, summarize...)
- **Why**: What's the purpose? (e.g., To explain to a beginner, to persuade a team...)
- **Where**: What's the context? (e.g., For a GitHub README, job interview, class report...)
- **How**: Specify format, tone, depth (e.g., Concise list, Markdown table, formal tone...)

### Common Mistakes
- Treating GenAI like a search engine
- Asking for quotes/facts/citations without verifying
- Giving up after one bad response
- Ignoring model biases
- Exposing PII

## Prompt Templates

### Template 1: Technical Explanation Prompt
```
You are an experienced software engineer. Explain the concept of thread synchronization to a high school student. Use simple analogies, a step-by-step breakdown, and include a real-world example from a bank account. Format it as bullet points.
```

### Template 2: Debugging Prompt
```
You are a Python expert helping a student debug code. The code calculates the factorial of a number, but returns incorrect results for negative inputs. Analyze the logic, identify errors, and rewrite the corrected function with inline comments.
```

### Template 3: Report Draft Prompt
```
Act as a software engineering intern writing the first draft of a weekly progress report for a supervisor. Summarize the completed tasks, current obstacles, and next week’s priorities in a professional tone. Include bullet points and a summary paragraph.
```

### Template 4: Brainstorming Prompt
```
You are a security consultant helping a college campus reduce phishing scams. Brainstorm 10 feasible, low-cost ideas tailored for a prestigious university. Organize the ideas into a table with columns for: Idea, Cost, and Impact.
```

### Template 5: Prompt Stack Example
**Prompt 1:**
```
Create a list of 10 possible senior capstone project ideas for a CSE student focused on embedded systems.
```
**Prompt 2:**
```
From the previous list, choose the 3 most practical ideas for a student with access to Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Describe each in 3–4 sentences.
```

## Best Practices
- **Be Specific**: The more context and constraints, the better the result
- **Use Examples**: Show what format/output you expect
- **Prompt Stack**: Break large tasks into smaller parts
- **Ask for Versions**: Get 2–3 alternatives and combine the best parts
- **Explain Reasoning**: Ask GenAI to walk through its thought process

---

## Ethics & Privacy
- Always **cite and verify** information from GenAI
- Never use it to fabricate or falsify data
- Avoid entering PII (Personally Identifiable Information
- Maintain academic integrity: **no AI-written essays or code submissions unless explicitly allowed**

### AI Privacy Policy Notes
| Tool         | Data Usage & Privacy                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| Claude       | Strong privacy and user protections    |
| ChatGPT      | Offers data deletion, age restrictions |
| Google Gemini| Heavy data tracking, but has opt-outs  |
| DeepSeek     | Stores data in China                   |

## Environmental Considerations
Using AI isn't free since it consumes power and water:
- Data centers require massive energy for training
- Increased pressure on energy grids
- Electronic waste from old hardware

Use AI intentionally.
