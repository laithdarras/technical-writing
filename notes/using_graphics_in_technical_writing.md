# Using Graphical Elements in Technical Writing

## Breaking Up the Monotony

- Dull writing can lose your reader. Using humor is fine, but only in limited circumstances.
- A better way to hold your reader’s attention is by using **graphical elements** such as:
  - Figures
  - Equations
  - Photographs
  - Tables
  - Flowcharts
- These elements add life to your writing and prevent dry, text-only passages.
- Bulleted lists (like this!) also help improve pace and readability.

## Modeling Ideas with Graphics

- The challenge is to **find the right type of graphic** to match the idea you’re explaining.
- Experiment with different **layouts, font sizes, and non-text elements** to keep the reader engaged.
- Use graphics to:
  - **Guide** the reader visually
  - **Clarify** complex logic
  - **Balance** text-heavy sections
- But beware: too many graphics can distract, while too few can lead to fatigue and confusion.

### Simple Example: Troubleshooting a Broken Lamp

Instead of writing:
> "If the lamp doesn’t work, check if it’s plugged in. If it isn’t, plug it in. If it is, check the bulb. If the bulb’s burned out, replace it. Otherwise, repair the lamp."

...just use a **flowchart**.

## Dealing with Figures
- Always include a **caption** describing the figure and assign it a unique number (just like above).
- Refer to the figure in the text **after it appears.**
- If you created the figure, you own the rights.
- If using someone else's figure:
    - You must **cite the source**.
    - You must **obtain the permission** unless you redraw the figure and make it your own (still cite the source though).

## Dealing with Tables
- Use tables to present structured data or comparisons
- Place the title above the table
- Use simple formatting to avoid confusion
- Always number and reference your tables in the text

### Simple Example: Truth Table
Here's a basic example of a truth table for the logical AND operator:
### Example: Truth Table for AND (A ∧ B)

| A | B | A ∧ B |
|---|---|--------|
| 0 | 0 |   0    |
| 0 | 1 |   0    |
| 1 | 0 |   0    |
| 1 | 1 |   1    |

- This shows that the result of A AND B is only true (1) when both A and B are true (1).
- You can do this to other logical operations like OR, XOR, NOT, etc., and even combine them as needed for more advanced documentation.

> Truth tables are actually very useful when communicating the logic of Boolean expressions in Software documentation!

## Dealing with Equations
- Equations are technical models - treat them like graphics
- Example ```E=mc^2``` represents the relationship between energy and mass
- Use equation editors (MS Word, Google Docs) or LaTeX for clean formatting
- You don't need to cite well-known equations, but do cite any proprietary formulas

## Summary Tips
- Use graphics purposefully, not decoratively
- Use text and graphics to complement one another
- Always label and cite graphics
