### 2. **Salutation**
- Use "Dear [Title] [Last Name]" for formal communication
- "Hello" or "Hi" is acceptable for less formal academic settings

### 3. **Opening Line**
- Briefly acknowledge the recipient or a prior interaction
- _Example:_ "I hope this message finds you well."

**Paragraph 3:** Wrap up and clearly state any actions needed

**Tips:**
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity
- Be concise and avoid unnecessary jargon

### 5. **Call to Action (CTA)**
- Clearly state what you need from the recipient
- _Example:_ "Could you confirm by Friday if the proposed meeting time works for you?"

### 6. **Closing and Sign-off**
- End with a polite note of appreciation or respect
- Use sign-offs like:
  - "Best regards,"
  - "Sincerely,"
