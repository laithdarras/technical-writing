evoking an emotional response. This document outlines what qualifies as technical writing, who writes it, and the major types it can take.

## What Makes Writing Technical?
- **Precision & Intent**: Unlike creative writing, TW focuses on delivering precise and actionable content.
- **Emotion-Free Tone**: The goal is to inform — not to persuade emotionally.
- **Persuasion Through Logic**: TW may persuade through reasoning and evidence.
- **Legal/Practical Impact**: Mistakes in TW can lead to significant consequences such as: financial and legal.
- **Not Dependent on Equations**: TW doesn’t require math to be technical — it could be a simple guide, manual, or set of instructions.

## Who Writes Technical Documentation?
Anyone whose profession has a technical component - not just engineers:
- Doctors, nurses, farmers, architects, analysts
- Scientists, engineers, researchers
- IT professionals, developers, QA testers

> **Key idea**: Before writing anything professionally, ask: *“Does this qualify as technical writing?”*
