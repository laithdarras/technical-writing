# Scientific Method vs. Engineering Design Method

At the end of the **introduction** of your proposal, but before you list and describe your **aims**, you will need a **key statement**.  
This key statement will be either a **hypothesis** or a **design statement**, depending on the type of project.

## When to Use Each Method

| Method              | Use Case                                       |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Scientific Method** | When **testing** something or conducting an **experiment** |
| **Engineering Method** | When **designing** a product or **creating** a test prototype |

## Null vs. Alternative Hypothesis

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: What we aim to disprove.  
  - If we can't disprove it, we "fail to reject" the null hypothesis.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ)**: The opposite of the null hypothesis.
- **H₀** should always be **measurable**; **Hₐ** represents the change we expect.

## What is a Research Hypothesis?

A **hypothesis** is a **prediction** of what you think will happen if a specific action is taken to solve a problem.

- It is a **tentative statement** about the relationship between **two or more variables**
- A good hypothesis addresses:
  - What is being changed (the independent variable)
  - What is expected to happen (the dependent variable)
  - Why you think this will occur (based on background research)

> This is a **key part of any quality experiment** and should **not be rushed!**

## How to Write a Clear Hypothesis

A well-structured hypothesis should incorporate **three key elements**:

1. The **problem**  
2. The **specific execution**  
3. The **expected result**

Once you craft your hypothesis, ask yourself:
- Is my hypothesis a **testable question**?
- Is it **clear and precise**?

---

### Hypothesis Template
`By [state the experiment change], we believe [what outcome will change], solving [state the problem].`

---

## Important Notes

- A hypothesis is more than a guess, it begins with a **question** and is **justified** through **background research**.
- A hypothesis **does not have to be correct**, research is meant to determine whether it is right or wrong.
- Once you have a hypothesis, consider how you would **test or falsify** it through **experimentation**.
  - This is known as **falsifiability**, a core principle of the scientific method.
