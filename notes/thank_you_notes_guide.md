Thank-you notes are short messages used to express appreciation. While often overlooked, they play a critical 
role in building professional relationships - whether you're following up after a meeting, interview, conference, or collaboration.

## Why Send a Thank You Note?
- Shows professionalism and gratitude
- Reinforces a positive impression

> Especially important after interviews, informational meetings, referrals, donations, or acts of support.

## When to Send
- Within **24–48 hours** of the event or meeting
- For interviews, ideally the **same day**

---

## Format: Handwritten vs. Email
