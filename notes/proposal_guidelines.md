# Proposal Writing Guidelines

## What is a Proposal?
A **proposal** is a bid, offer, or request to perform a project. It includes all the necessary supporting information required to gain approval. 

> A proposal may need to convince the recipient that the project needs to be done, but it **must always** convince them that **you** (the proposer) are the right individual or organization to do it.

---

## Types of Proposals
More than one may apply:

1. **Solicited**  
   - **Formal:** Organization publicizes a Request for Proposal (RFP)  
   - **Informal:** Initiated via phone, email, or in-person invite  
   - Usually highly competitive — **follow instructions carefully**

2. **Unsolicited**  
   - Initiated by proposer, not recipient

3. **Internal**  
   - Typically uses memo format  
   - Shorter; less background/qualifications needed

4. **External**  
   - Business letter + formal report  
   - Background and qualifications must be **very convincing**

> Note: Proposal formats are not rigid — tailor based on purpose and audience.

## Core Components
*Note: Components may be renamed, merged, or omitted.*

- Title page
- Executive summary (or project summary)
- Introduction
- Background (contextual — different from intro)
- Proposal statement
- Description of work product
- Project benefits and feasibility
- Method of approach
- Goals and rationale
- Experimental plan
- Expected outcomes
- Problems and alternatives
- Timeline
- Qualifications and references
- Cost estimates

---

## Title & Title Page
- Use a **clear, unambiguous title** — don't get fancy
- Words should reflect **focus** of the proposal; important words come first
- Cover should be **professional, not flashy**
- Include team members, project leads, and supervisors if relevant
- Avoid overly long titles — aim for <1 sentence; if long, use a colon

---

## Project Summary (Executive Summary)
- Usually labeled **Page 1** (cover page is not counted)
- Limit to **1 paragraph** (1 page max)
- Use **present/future tense**
- Busy stakeholders may read only this — make it clear, concise, specific
- Paint a picture of the proposed work

> Key Idea: **Write this last** — after completing the full proposal!

---

## Introduction
- State the **purpose** clearly
- Reference any prior contact or info source
- Introduce the **problem** (1 paragraph):
  - Why is this problem important?
  - What's been done before?
  - What's missing?
  - What do you propose?
- State **hypothesis** or **design statement**
- List 2–3 **goals/aims**, each with a rationale

---

## Background
Especially important for unsolicited proposals. Show:
- Familiarity with past work
- Uniqueness and importance of your proposal
- How your project avoids previous mistakes

**Structure:**
- Start with a **significance paragraph**
- Review relevant literature (cite!)

---

## Proposal Statement
- Clearly and **explicitly** state what you propose to do
- Address **scope** (what’s included AND what’s not)
- Clarify if future stages will follow
- Consider referencing alternate approaches

---

## Description of Work Product
- What will the client actually receive?
  - Building, software, report, blueprint, plan, etc.
- Clarify the **scope of work**

---

## Project Benefits & Feasibility
- Especially important for unsolicited proposals
- Address **benefits and challenges**

---

## Method of Approach
- Describe **how** you’ll achieve your goals
- Justify your method if needed
- Mention theory, equipment, client responsibilities
- Show professional knowledge (without arrogance)

**For each Aim:**
```text
Aim 1: Title
- Goals & rationale
- Experimental plan (with measurable objectives)
- Expected outcomes
- Problems and alternatives
```
Repeat for each aim.

---

## Goals vs. Objectives
- **Goals** = broad purpose, not easily measurable
- **Objectives** = measurable, specific achievements
- Evaluation depends on objectives → make them quantifiable!

---

## Detailed Methods
- Tie your **methods to your objectives**
- Be explicit
- Mention collaborators, project design, visuals
- Include tidy diagrams and subsections

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Define **what success looks like**
- Be quantitative (as much as possible)
- Reference your objectives when describing evaluations
- Create internal consistency across proposal sections

---

## Schedule / Timeline
- Use table, Gantt chart, or flow diagram
- Include month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter tasks
- Defend your timeline:
  - How will you stay on track?

---

## Qualifications & References
- Showcase your **team’s credentials**
- Reference past work or successes
- Include brief resumes if required
- Cite relevant literature

---

## Cost Estimate
- Detail will vary depending on audience

**Categories may include:**
- Direct costs
- Supplies
- Equipment
- Labor (hrs × rate)
- Indirect costs (e.g., university overhead)

---

## ✏Writing Style Considerations
- Minimize jargon and abbreviations
- Avoid trendy terms or fluff
- Be consistent with headings and subheadings
- Number figures/tables in order; cite them in the text

---
