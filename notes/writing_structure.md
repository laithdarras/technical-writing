# Writing Structure in Technical Writing

Strong organization and consistent style are key elements of effective technical communication. 
This guide covers best practices for structuring your writing, revising content, and choosing precise, audience-appropriate language.

## Organization is Key
- Plan ahead: **Create an outline or strategy before writing**
- Use standard formats with clear headings and subheadings
- Follow assignment rubrics or document conventions

### Common Organizational Styles (for reports, overviews, etc.):
- **Spatial**: Farthest to closest, left to right, etc.
- **Difficulty**: Easiest to most complex
- **Alphabetical**: Ordered by letter
- **Chronological**: Earliest to latest
- **Problem/Solution**: Define a problem, then provide a solution
- **Inverted Pyramid**: Lead with the most important point (journalism)
- **Deductive**: Start with a general idea, then narrow to details (science)
- **Inductive**: Start with examples, then conclude with a general insight
- **List-Based**: Bullet points or numbered ideas (like this file!)

## Plan for Multiple Revisions
### The "Spit, Prune, Polish" Model:
- **Spit**: Get all your ideas down quickly
- **Prune**: Cut fluff and re-organize
- **Polish**: Refine grammar, structure, tone, and formatting

> Don’t try to make your first draft perfect, that’s what revision is for.

## Tips for Clarity
- Write sentences that can be **spoken aloud in a single breath**
- Tell the story in the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion**
- Avoid long intros and rushed conclusions
- **Proofread** with a peer or GenAI tool

## Conciseness
- Eliminate redundancy
- Avoid vague terms, **choose specific, accurate words**
- It’s okay to use **first person**, but do so sparingly
- Prioritize **analysis** over opinion

---

## Language
- Avoid gendered language: “they” is acceptable for unknown gender
- Avoid overstatements: e.g., “everyone,” “never,” “always”
- Use **hedging words** when appropriate: “seemingly,” “possibly,” “likely”
- Adopt the **jargon and terminology** of your professional field

> Model your language choices on respected publications in your domain.
